# dehaze
A dehaze method based on CAP, guidedfilter and quadtree

## Preface
The Matlab code for this project came from one of my seniors, and I mainly just modified it to Python and C++ code.

## Instructions
Under the `Images` folder are some fogged photos.

Under the `Results` file are the results after defogging.

In the `Python` folder, there is a code based on dark channel dehaze.

Note that the path inside the code needs to be modified by yourselfÔºÅ
